# Password Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

## Description 

This webpage uses JavaScript to generate a random password, given the parameters provided by the user. Upon entering the app, a user will be faced with the form which will require a user to enter the desired parameters for a password, including length and what kind of characters to include in it: ![Screenshot of form](assets/images/form.png)

After filling out the form with the desired parameters, the form will disappear and a randomly generated password fitting the specified parameters will appear in the generate password box: ![Screenshot of password](assets/images/password.png)

The user must then copy (command+c for MacOS or control+c for Windows) and paste (command+v for MacOS or control+v for Windows) the password into a password creation box when creating a new account for something. The user is then advised to use a password keycahin feature installed in most computers to save the password. 

If a user inputs an invalid value for password length or characters, they will be redirected to the form. 

By finishing this project, I was able to practice using JavaScript basics learned from class. I was able to experiment with different logic configuations to get the same desired output.

## Contributing

For the first rendition of this application, Tutor Alexis Gonzalez was consulted and helped in clarifying some logic and altenrate ways to have the same output. 

For the first rendition of this applicatio, the website MDN was also consulted often. I used MDN's try it feature particularly to run certain parts of code in isolation to experiment and ensure it would work. I also consulted [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition_assignment) to see the += assigner's function. 

Following updates to this application, no other developers contributed.
