# Password Generator

## Description 

This webpage uses JavaScript to generate a random password, given the parameters provided by the user. Clicking the red "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts requesting user input regarding length of password and types of caracters to use before outputting a random password, using the specified parameters. The series of sequences will look like the following screenshots: 
![Screenshot-length-input](assets/images/screenshot-1.png)
![Screenshot-character-input](assets/images/screenshot-2.png)

After inputting desired parameters, the randomly generated password will appear in the generate password box" 
![Screenshot-random-password](assets/images/screenshot-6.png)

The user must then copy (command+c for MacOS or control+c for Windows) and paste (command+v for MacOS or control+v for Windows) the password into a password creation box when creating a new account for something. The user is then advised to use a password keycahin feature installed in most computers to save the password. 

If a user inputs an invalid value for password length, the following pop up will appear: 
![Screenshot-invalid-length](assets/images/screenshot-7.png)

If a user chooses to allow no characters, the following pop up wil appear: 
![Screenshot-invalid-characters](assets/images/screenshot-8.png)

By finishing this project, I was able to practice using JavaScript basics learned from class. I was able to experiment with different logic configuations to get the same desired output.

## Credits

Tutor Alexis Gonzalez was consulted and helped in clarifying some logic and altenrate ways to have the same output. 

The website MDN was also consulted often. I used MDN's try it feature particularly to run certain parts of code in isolation to experiment and ensure it would work. I also consulted [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition_assignment) to see the += assigner's function.
